- add polyphony parameter
    - polyphony is controlled by pot instead of button

- read multiplexer documentation to figure out optimal delay
    - rn is 2ms? 
    - also implement a poll every n ms instead of arduino delay

- ADD DIFFERENT SCALING OPTIONS - 127 VS 1023 (just ctrlf !)

- if (!envelope_on.state), then don't change the envelope parameters
    - or maybe even set all params to 0
